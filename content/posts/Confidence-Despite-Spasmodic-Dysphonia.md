RFK Jr's speech impediment is caused by a rare disorder called Spasmodic Dysphonia, which causes the vocal chords to open and slam shut uncontrollably. Whereas at first he seems of ill health and timid, after watching a few of the long form interviews with him, the man is full of confidence and sincerity and is very smart.

RFK publicizing his workout routine and physique may at first seem irrelevant or egotistical, but I think it's a good early move considering that his speech impediment could give the impression that he is of ill health.
