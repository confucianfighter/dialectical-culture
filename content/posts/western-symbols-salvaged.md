### Similarities and differences between east and west.
I think that many have come to the realization that most world religions are saying the same thing. More specifically the spiritual **practices** of those who take their religions seriously in the east and the west are more similar than they are different. Moreover even stronger similarities are to be found among the founders such as Jesus and Sidhartha.

However, there is a difference in how these ideas are expressed, and on the emphasis.  

The east is much more about the collective and less about the individual. Emphasis is placed on overcoming the illusion of our being separate individuals. The main cause of suffering is in false perceptions around being separate from eachother and our environment. Liberation is to be found in compassion through identification. Namely we see ourselves in all lifeforms.  

But the west finds our separateness and individuality to be inescapable and grapples with this as its main focus. Liberation is to be found in individual freedom and love, and suffering is caused by a lack of love. Love is that thing which, knowing it is separate, always gives, and endures suffering with joy. Western religions feature an illusory higher power, and, in our finitude, surrender to that higher power is what makes us whole, and capabable of love.



### Culture is relative, but culture is King
There is a sense in which we are fools to throw out everything to do with the spirituality and morals of our own culture. Things are relative for sure, but indeed they are related in real ways.

I have moved over and over and have parted with most of my stuff but one of the books I couldn't part with was ***Being Good: A short introduction to ethics*** by Simon Blackburn. In it there is a chapter on relativism with a suprising twist he draws from Greek Historian, Herodotus. He includes a passage in book III of the histories in which Herodotus critisizes the king of Cambyses, who was the son of Cyrus. Cyrus was the emperor of Persia, but Cambyses held Persian laws in contempt:
> "Everything goes to make me certain that Cambyses was completely mad; otherwise he would not have gone in for mocking religion and tradition. If one were to order all mankind to choose the best set of rules in the world, each group would, after due consideration, choose its own customs; each group regards its own as being by far the best. So it is unlikely that anyone except a madman would laugh at such things.

> "There is plenty of other evidence to support the idea that this opinion of one's own customs is universal, but here is one instance. During Darius's reign, he invited some Greeks who were present to a conference, and asked them how much money it would take for them to be prepared to eat the corpses of their fathers; they replied that they would not do that for any amount of money. Next, Darius summoned some members of the Indian tribe known as Callatiae, who eat their parents, and asked them in the presence of Greeks, with an interpreter present so that they could understand what was being said, how much money it would take for them to be willing to cremate their father's corpses; they cried out in horror and told him not to say such appalling things. So these practices have become enshrined as customs just as they are, and I think Pindar was right to have said in his poem that custom is king of all."

### Philosophy of Christianity
For 2 1/2 years I went to a group that explored Christianity as a philosophy and world religion. It wasn't so much soul searching but more that I had learned that in all cases it is rational to put love and forgiveness above all, and I wanted to make sure I cemented that into my thinking. I also found that while I will always be a type of spiritual agnostic, when I avoided the christian terminology of my culture altogether, I was at a loss for words sometimes in spiritual matters, which simply made it more difficult to keep spiritual matters at the forefront of my mind. 


### Why I kept Going
I had very little hope of salvaging much from Christianity. I kept going to the group for two reasons. 1. The pastor running the group had strong liberal opinions. A liberal Christian. It's true. Aliens are real, and also there are liberal Evangelical christians. 2. I'm not superstitious except when I am. The pastor was from Wellington Alabama and his dad worked at NASA in Huntsville. My dad was from Wellington Alabama and his dad worked for NASA in Huntsville as well.

### The Driving Question
After a few months, my driving question became this: "What the hell did they say to the early christians, that they would gladly throw themselves to the lions, and that against all odds it eventually became the dominant religion of Rome?
This was not a society like ours in which people can be shielded from reality. I found it hard to believe that the original message was the message which we currently hear from Christians or even in the bible, for that matter. So, for me, the bible was simply a historical artifact from which to try and excavate a certain historical figure and movement along with possibly other artifacts.

### Patience, the Quentessential Virtue
So when I first posed this question, the pastor brought some research he had done on the early church when he was working on his doctorates in theology. 

***Patience*** was the primary virtue of the early church. So much so that they would spend a year getting to know someone and helping them in their own spiritual growth and self improvement before revealing any of their beliefs. In fact, it was through the demonstration of this kind of patience in daily living that an initiate might first take interest and inquire. 

They had a belief that people would eventually come around. That people were worthwhile. It was unlimitted patience. Very similar to the radical acceptance of mindfulness, but applied on a broader social level.
This suggests two things:
1. The movement had nothing to do with the instant results that the modern evangelicals tout.
2. Faith meant both faith in the higher power, and faith in people.

### Gradual Anarchy -- The Kingdom is Within
One thing that struck me after a while of going through the texts and putting things into historical context, was that, for a man living in a theocracy, and for a man with some kind of background in the most strict religious sect within that theocracy, Jesus' language was decidedly non-religious. He flagrantly broke the law. And he never particiapates in government except in the most minimal obligations. He stood in civil disobedience toward everything his government stood for. 

Some saw him as a threat, and when questioned he would say that his father's ***kingdom*** was "not of this world." That the ***kingdom*** of God is within. As a thought experiment, I put this into modern terms: "My father's ***government*** is not of this world, the ***government*** of God is within.

Toward the Roman government he showed indifference, and toward his own goverment he showed contempt. He showed no interest in the affairs of government and made no coordinated effort towards political change.

Instead he spent his time building relationships with people, and with the populace. He was the kind of guy who would show up at a friends house and invite them to go into the hillside and meditate with him. He invested in people and had faith in people. He might say, the best thing you can do, is be someone's friend.

One could make a case that he saw that government would ultimately never work. Where there is government there is war. And why call it war? We should call it "people-getting-their-faces-blown-off". If people need to be governed, then for that very reason, government won't work, because the government itself is comprised of people.

So it's the people that need to change. From within. Any form of government would work just fine if people would do the right thing. But if people do the right thing, no form of government is required. 

The government of God is within. It would be an oxymoron to take it by force. Jesus represents a vision for the future, in this regard.

So government won't work. People need to radically change.

To be sure, there is a second sense in which the ***kingdom is within***.

### The Miracles -- Good People
There is some debate as to wether the human mind has some kind of psychic powers or if peole can learn to do some kind of supernatural healing. I'm undecided, but there is more supporting evidence than I used to think. Short of miracles, there are many cases in which a person, just by virtue of their love and compassion could be said to have a transformative and miraculous effect on those around them. And one would be hard pressed to capture the magnitude and quality of this with words. Yet I think these are the kinds of people that our very conception of God comes from. I'd much rather have them than miracles.
    
What if everyone could be like that? Like the one each of us has surely met who seems to possess so much inner gravity, strength, and palpable love that they touch the hearts of everyone they meet. Many people are starved for love, and to have such a friend, for them, would be a bigger miracle than they could ever ask for.

Next to buddist compassion, or christian agopee, miracles pale. They are simply irrelevent. Yet I could see how perhaps for lack of words, you'd almost have to ascribe miracles to such a person.

### There was Indeed Good news
If anything at all was accurately preserved about the man, Jesus surely was such a person of inexaustible love and gravity, and the good news he brought was that he himself was NOT special. All deserve to be strong and good and to possess god-like inner strength and gravity. Rarely do we hear this enough from the people we look up to. 
The good news was that, none of the outer stuff mattered. Not temple, nor sacrifices, nor keeping laws, nor specific beliefs, nor doctrines, nor theological technicalities. The thing that Jesus had was as free as dirt, and available to all. There shall be no talk of worthy nor unworthy, neither good nor bad, cowardly nor brave. We are all worthy. We all have the right to be strong and to try to love and be good, no matter our past.

We can all have that light within us. That thing we see in those amazing people from which our very conception of God comes. This is the second sense in which the kingdom of God is within.

### The Cosmic Battle of Love vs Fear -- Or, Pluck your Eye Out
I have found the idea of good vs evil hard to palate. Just having these two things within one's ontology seems inevitably to lead to judgemental thinking. But I can totally buy into the idea that literally there is a cosmic battle of love vs fear. If life on other planets is anything like our own, it will have pain, suffering and fear. Fear itself is what makes the other two intolerable. Fear leads to violence. Fear leads to intolerance. Fear leads to dissociation and mental illness. Fear leads to hesitation and acting in less than heroic ways that I later regret. Fear prevents us from letting it rip and reaching our fullest potential. Fear causes us to hoard things, steal from our neighbors. Kill. Fear causes war.

If your right eye is causing you to be fearful. Pluck it out. Seriously.

Ok, not seriously, but I think that's the sense in which Jesus was saying those kinds of things. 

The world is full of fear. People are full of fear. People need to be governed. The governing people are full of fear. Jesus, I think, saw himself as on a 200 year peace mission that was going to outlast him. I don't think he was thinking 2200, years, and I'm just adding 200 to my own time, because... well things have sped up, havent they? We should all live our lives as if it's a 200 year peace mission that's going to outlast us. 

### The Vision --- Worth Every Effort
So there is a love within that is worth every effort to nurture and guard from fear, and there is a vision of a future of truly brave and peaceful and self governed people who, when push comes to shove, stand in harms way for what's right and that too is worth every effort. To me, few other things, at the end of my own life, would I count as having been worth contributing to. 

So in this sense, I can see why Jesus used the kinds of parables that Jesus used in which he says to be wise as serpents, to trade everything to in order gain one inch for the kingdom, to simply accept human nature and look way beyond to promote this future vision. To trick ourselves into doing the hard things. To use everything at our disposal. Can I develop an AI tool that can help me train myself to be a better person? Then I'd better. Would a swim in the ocean open up my heart a bit, but I'm afraid of the sharks? I'd better jump in that water!  

### Caveat 
While my conclusions about who Jesus was and what his vision might have been could be totally false, I think the important thing is that, if possible, people should try to come to terms with the religionand symbols of the culture in which they were raised. Now that I have worked out these things for myself, I can now draw inspiration from my heritage instead of feeling resentment. I also have a harmonious way in which to frame Christianity with modern philosophy and eastern religions like Buddhism. But in many ways I now disagree with the mainstream interprettation of christianity more, not less. But even in those circles I now have something positive to contribute to the converation and a more palatable way in which to reframe some of the more abraisive things that are said.
