I have some thoughts on this. Take this as a placeholder for now.

Here is a paper on [The Location and Reconstruction of a Byzantine Structure
in Marea, Egypt, Including a Comparison of Electronic
Remote Sensing and Remote Viewing](https://www.scientificexploration.org/docs/33/jse_33_3_Schwartz.pdf) by STEPHAN A. SCHWARTZ of The Mobius Group.

While I have heard many scientists claim that experiments like this one and those of the CIA can't be replicated, it seems that it would take a skilled individual to pull this kind of thing out of people. Our heads are so noisy. In this way, it would seem to be more of an art. It would be similar to saying that a painting of Michaelanelo is not reproducible. Did they find the right artist? 

So this kind of thing remains a mystery, but I don't think cases like this should be dismissed. Sure it's good to be rigorous and try and work against our own desires for the universe to be meaningful. But ultimately this working against our own desires should be towards the goal of having a neutral stance, and not a stance unduly biased against ourselves.
