All of the work in ***QED - Quantumn Electrodynamics***, was finished by Richard Feynman. QED deals with light, positrons, electrons,  and their interactions. ***QCD - Quantumn Chromodynamics***, however still has many mysteries to be solved. It deals with protons, neutrons, the quarks that comprise them, and the gluons they exchange between themselves. Gluons are the subatomic counterpart of photons. This video describes how AI has already solved a very complex and central problem in particle physics. 

A fundamental breakthrough may be just around the corner.
