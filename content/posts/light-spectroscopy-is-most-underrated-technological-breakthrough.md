Light spectroscopy changed the world overnight.

Have you ever wondered how they know what the stars are made of? Have you ever found it hard to believe scientists could be so sure ***they*** know?

Have you ever wondered how astronomers know how fast a star is moving?

Have you ever wondered how we went from knowing practically nothing about the universe in the 1800s to the chemical makeup of the entire universe by the turn of the 20th century and then made once leap in physics after another?

I'll give you a hint. It wasn't aliens.

Look no further for the answer to all these seemingly impossible questions. Light spectroscopy is as simple as the lightbulb. Which is simpler than a candle. 

In short it was discovered that if you take the light coming off of an object and put it through a prism, there will be specific bands of color either present or missing where the electrons that comprise the material of the thing are jumping valences at specific energy levels and either absorbing or releasing a photon. From this it can be deduced what the thing is made of.

Kathy, from ***Kathy Loves Physics & History*** covers the basic concept and story behind the discovery in the video below. 

Kathy, btw, does her homework on the History of Physics like no other. I can't say enough about her work.

Her video covers everything except determining the speed of celestial bodies via the doppler effect (red shift and blue shift).

Just as a sound seems to be of a lower frequency when the light source is moving away from the listener, and of a higher frequency when moving toward the listener, light, when you put it through a prism, will appear closer to the red end of the spectrum if the source is moving away from the observer, and more toward the blue end if the source is moving toward the observer.

All of this is fine and good. But it's a star light years away. How do we know how much more blue or red it looks than normal if we don't know the original color?

It turns out to be pretty simple. If you noticed, in the video, the bands not only are of specific colors, but they also are of a varied pattern of spacing from eachother.

So, they don't go by the spectral color, they go by the pattern of spacing in the spectral lines, from that they determine the material, and then go by how far ***shifted*** up or down the spectrum towards the red or blue end it appears on the spectroscope than normal. And this indicates the relative speed between earth and the light source.
