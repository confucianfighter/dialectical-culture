I used to laugh at the idea of UFOs. Then I saw a youtube video titled: UFO captured on SPY-1 Radar. I was a radar repair technician in the Navy. I am pretty familiar with the physics and processing involved. SPY-1 was the most advanced radar in the fleet when I was in. Whatever this was, it was probably not an optical illusion. So I clicked on what I thought might be click bait. And... it wasn't. I racked my brain for days. I had all kinds of theories about what kind of United States technologies this could be. NADA. 

The Nimitz encounter happened in 2004. The USS Nimitz was in the pacific headed south from San Diego. Senior Chief Day testifies that they picked up some strange contacts on the SPY-1 that seemed to come out of Catalina Island. From Catalina Island to Baja Mexico they had about 100 of those contacts on the radar pulling maneuvers that didn't make sense. Like dropping from near orbit to sea level in 1 second.

They called in the electronics technician to see if there was a malfunction. I forget his name, but he says everything checked out good.

Eventually Senior Chief Day obtained permission to dispatch some fighter jets to investigate. 

That's where Commander David Fravor comes in. Commander David Fravor had nearly 20 years in as a fighter pilot at the time and was Top Gun trained. Yes, there is a Top Gun trainining command. It's in Miramar near San Diego. 

And fortunately there is ample evidence he indeed was the Black Aces Squadron Commander on board the USS Nimitz in the PBS Documentary called [Carrier](https://youtu.be/Qjaye_1QDx4?t=2589)  

He didn't speak of what he saw until well after he retired. 

Here is the exact [interview with David Fravor on the Lex Fridman Podcast](https://youtu.be/aB8zcAttP1E) which,  after watching, I stopped laughing at the idea of UFOs.

The Nimitz Encounter was also covered in the documentary series "Unidentified". They interview several crew members on that one. A few years later a few other pilots involved who were eye witnesses came out on 60 minutes.
