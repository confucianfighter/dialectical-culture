I've been following some recent events regarding UAP that have barely made it mainstream except for on [NEWSNATION](https://youtu.be/6DN02ReHNp0). 

In late April I was happy to see that NASA was finally taking the UAP issue seriously and had established a panel of about 20 people to pull resources and equipment to track the phenomena and determine what they were. Representatives from AARO were there and they were saying that they had seen no ***verifiable*** evidence that these things were of extraterrestrial origin. 

Then in early June a guy from intel named David Grusch comes forward and calls bullshit, they have very good reason to believe that it is of extraterrestrial origin. 

Here is an excerpt from his [wikipedia bio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Grusch_UFO_whistleblower_claims):
>Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,[1] Grusch was a decorated combat officer within the USAF during the War in Afghanistan and is a veteran of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).[2] From 2019 to 2021, he was the representative of the NRO to the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force.[3] From late 2021 to July 2022, he was the co-lead for UAP analysis at the NGA and its representative to the task force.[3] He assisted in drafting the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023,[4] which includes provisions for reporting of UFOs, including whistleblower protections and exemptions to non-disclosure orders and agreements.[5][6][7]

He claims that while AARO has not ***verified*** claims which have been brought to their attention, the statement that they have recieved no ***verifiable*** evidence is very misleading, and in fact several people have come forward claiming to have directly been involved with a program that has retrieved multiple craft of non-human origin over the years.   
[Here is the full interview with David Grusch on NEWSNATION ](https://youtu.be/6DN02ReHNp0)
There have since been private hearings within congress with Grusch and those who had come to Grusch. 

As a result some [legislation](https://defensescoop.com/2023/06/27/senates-intelligence-authorization-bill-questions-reverse-engineering-of-government-recovered-uaps/) was  included in the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) for fiscal year 2024 mandating that within 60 days everyone "currently or formerly" under contract with the federal government who is in possession of or has information about non-earth origin material protected under any kind of SAP (special access program) must come forward. As well the bill prohibits any spending not authorized by congress involving this list of things: 

1. "Recruiting, employing, training, equipping, and operations of, and providing security for, government or contractor personnel with a primary, secondary, or contingency mission of capturing, recovering, and securing unidentified anomalous phenomena craft or pieces and components of such craft."
2. "Analyzing such craft or pieces or components thereof, including for the purpose of determining properties, material composition, method of manufacture, origin, characteristics, usage and application, performance, operational modalities, or reverse engineering of such craft or component technology."
3. "Managing and providing security for protecting activities and information relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena from disclosure or compromise."
4. "Actions relating to reverse engineering or replicating unidentified anomalous phenomena technology or performance based on analysis of materials or sensor and observational information associated with unidentified anomalous phenomena."
5. "The development of propulsion technology, or aerospace craft that uses propulsion technology, systems, or subsystems, that is based on or derived from or inspired by inspection, analysis, or reverse engineering of recovered unidentified anomalous phenomena craft or materials."
6. "Any aerospace craft that uses propulsion technology other than chemical propellants, solar power, or electric ion thrust."

This is much more aggressive than the 6 month mandate issued in 2021 simply demanding that all intel aggencies compile and present any and all info they can share on UAP to congress. And even that led shortly after to the establishment of AARO, and the more recent involvement of NASA. 

So if ***that*** mandate made in 2021 made this kind of a splash, what will be the two year impact of this latest issue?
