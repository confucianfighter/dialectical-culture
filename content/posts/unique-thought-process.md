The pilots I knew in the Navy on Coronado island were some of my favorite people. While USAF pilots have their own unique qaulities and culture, Ryan Graves is decidedly representative of the Navy pilots. They aren't all physicists and engineers like him, but there seem to be some common qualities. Sharp, fit, highly educated, yet the ones I knew were down to earth and did not see themselves as above me or any of the other enlisted. A high level of curiosity seemed to be another common quaility. He speaks mostly of what it's like to be a figher pilot and some of the technology involved. He speaks a little of his UAP encounters but most of the value of this video is in the former.
