The original formulation of Occam's razor is "Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem," which translates to "Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity."

This is often assumed to mean that given competing explanations, the simplest explanation is true.

If this were the case, we should throw out most of science as we know it.

I took an interdisciplinary honor's course in the humanities about the Renaissance and enlightenment periods. We studied Occam's razor.

The best example of how it is meant, is to be found in Copernicus and Newton.

It was assumed that the planets and stars and sun revolved around us, we were at the center of everything.

But this required increasingly complicated explanations of the motions of the planets as observations became more accurate. For instance, they introduced the notion of "ellipticals". 

Then Copernicus discovered that you could bypass all these complicated calculations if you assumed that we aren't special and that the earth and the planets revolve around the sun. The calculations were simpler and more accurate. The earth below us moved in the same kinds of paths as the stars above us.

Then there was Isaac Newton. It was assumed in his day that the planets and stars were made of a special material called ether that moved in circular motions. Everything we know moves in straight lines, they thought, but surely the celestial bodies were different. But Isaac Newton was into Alchemy and their motto was: "As below so above." This led to him thinking that perhaps the planets are made of the same stuff everything on earth is made of. The planets would move in straight motions, except they are falling toward the sun. This simplified calculations even further and made them even more accurate. The takeway there "Don't assume that things strange and distant are any different from the things close at hand.", or more in the direction I'm going: It's a safer bet to simply extrapolate indefinitely from what we know until it's proven otherwise.

Then there was Darwin. We had assumed they we were different from the animals, and we also had our tribal assumptions that far away humans who seem different and have a different skin color must not even be of the same species as ourselves. But since they could reproduce with each other, we made up the idea of race. Darwin's findings were that humans have a much less amount of variation in their physical traits as compared to the variations found within most other species of mammal. Additionally, we followed the same general variations depending on geographic distrubuition as the rest of the animal kingdom.

Extrapolating out can have some seemingly strange implications. For instance, Einstein. His theory of General relativity proved to be true but predicted black holes and expansion. He made the mistake of cutting his extrapolation short and later regretted it. The takeaway, trust the math better than common sense. This was proven to be the case in quantum physics as well with things like entanglement and spooky action at a distance.

As below so above. That is closer to the spirit of Occam's razor. The safest bet is to extrapolate out from what we know. Yet it was assumed for the longest time that we must not anthropomorphize animals and assume that they are conscious like us and experience pain. It is often even suggested we can't even assume other human's are conscious despite that they display similar traits that we associate with our own consciousness. This is so backward. We should assume this to be the case until proven otherwise!

The same kind of assumptions were made with flight. Animals can fly. Humans are different and will never fly. Scientists produced loads of "evidence" to support this claim until after the first flight and the news made it far enough.

We ought to have learned by now. For instance, the possibility of nearby alien lifeforms. By our most conservative estimates, life should have evolved elsewhere and even without light speed travel, it would have populated the entire galaxy by now toIt would make sense then, to go by the math on this one and be resonable when credible people come forward. We should assume until proven otherwise that if earth is teaming with life, so is the rest of the galaxy.
