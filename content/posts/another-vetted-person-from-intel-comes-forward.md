Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, but consider the premise of the fermi paradox: By all conservative estimates, if intelligent life evolved anywhere in our galaxy, even without FTL travel, they would have populated the entire galaxy by now. "So where are they?" it continues. Many have used this as the reason not to listen to testimony or look at evidence. On the contrary, the premise says that we should be considering both evidence and testimony.
