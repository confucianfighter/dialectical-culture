This whole thing is very telling. 

It would be hard to capture the extent of what went down in this hearing in the news. 

People need to watch this for themselves.

The contrast between the media coverage and the actual hearing is pretty enlightening and will inform the way in which I interpret headlines and sound bites in the future.

I just spent an hour writing out my opinion, but I think it's best people just see for themselves. I wouldn't have believed a retelling as to how this hearing went down or even a re-enactment.
