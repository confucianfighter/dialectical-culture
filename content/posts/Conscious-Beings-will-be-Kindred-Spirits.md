The netflix film, "My Octopus Teacher" should give us an idea of what to expect of other intelligent life.

If we have more in common with an octopus than not by virtue of being concious, we will have plenty in common with other intelligent biological entities. The octopus is so vastly different from us in brain structure, yet it showed in that documentary so many human traits such as wit, industry, appetite,curiosity, and a desire to connect. 

In addition, I think non human intelligent biological entities like us who have time to sit and reflect on themselves, will hold conciousness to be sacred just like us. They will experience pleasure and pain just like us. They might even have the same questions. Conciousness shows no signs of being knowable or proveable thus far. I personally hope that bigger brains will demonstrate that conciousness is much more than we currently think it is. Maybe they will have some kind of telepathic abilities. Perhaps we will learn that conciousness is indeed non-locality. Or maybe we will find they haven't gotten an inch further than us in figuring out what life actually is.    

NOTE: I am not so naive to assume that a vistting species will be peaceful, but if not, then they are even more like us, and we are still not alone, so in a way this is still good news because it would mean the universe is teaming with life and surely there are others like us to carry on the torch, so to speak.
