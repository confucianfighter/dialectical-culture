###NASA Holds First Public Meeting on UFO Study
I would just like to point out that the fact that we have gotten to this point in the last few years from where people would put you in a loony bin for even mentioning UFOs, to NASA holding a public meeting is mostly do to the work of Luis Elizondo And Chris Melon. Basically they have been on a destigmatization campaign since 2017 and have been working behind the scenes with others within the DOD cutting throught red tape, removing legal barriers and other things. 

I found what Sean Kirkpatrick said a about the kind of sensors that intel has as compared to the DOD to be interesting: 
> "a vast majority of what we have reported to us are from DOD sensors, DOD sensors are not scientific sensors they are not intelligence Community sensors. Believe it or not, intelligence Community sensors are very close to Scientific sensors; they are calibrated; they are high Precision; they are [i.e. can detect] everything you'd ever want to know about a thing. DOD sensors have one purpose they are to identify an object that is known and put a weapon on it." 

I mean, if their radar and cameras can detect "everything you ever want to know about a thing", that implies high res x-ray as well as high res spectroscopic imaging not to mention the more conventional ones.  

All I want for christmas are spectroscopic goggles.
