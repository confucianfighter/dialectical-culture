If you want to tell a lie, it's the oldest trick in the book to say that it's a well guarded secret. 

And indeed the coverups seem to be an all too convenient part of the story. 

But consider that if what the whistle blowers and others are saying is true:

1. It is said that they have detected blue shift, and that along with the more obvious things like an apparent lack of connection with inertia, a lack of any sonic boom, and apparent gravitational lensing indicates that these craft are bending space.

2. This is possible according to general relativity, but to do it for one second would require an extraordinary amount of energy. Which is an understatement. Most speculation on warp drive speaks of the energy of our entire sun.

3. Which is also possible according to physics if this technology harnesses, say, zero point energy, which could be taken from a cubic yard of space.

4. So whereas a nuclear bomb might have the coverage of an entire county (fallout aside) requiring many bombs for an apocalypse, this technology would have the potential to physically obliterate the entire planet with one bomb.

Therefore, looking at it from the perspective of the antagonist in the narrative, if I were in government and was shown craft and bodies, but they laid this danger out to me and really proved it, I would not speak. I would be a bad person if I spoke. I would only present biological evidence to the public. And maybe not even that. As soon as the world knows we have bodies, they know we have craft, and every country will demand access to the technology, and rightfully so. This SHOULD be covered up, unless we have already successfully reverse engineered the technology, which very well might be the case, or unless our major competing superpowers already know, which also may very well be the case. At least these is how I would be less global economy than our current one, like during the cold war.

So then the point is made that given how clumsy our government is, how could they possibly keep such a thing a secret for so long even if they wanted to?

I think it would be pretty easy. Even with lots of fumbles.

Consider these things:

1. The United States spends over 800 billion dollars on the military per year

2. Money talks. In the interviews of the Brazil encounter of 96 in the documentary ***Moment of Contact***, a large sum of money was offered to a woman on condition she spend it outside of brazil if she would denounce the testimony of her daughters to the press. One of the guys in the interview DID move out of country for nearly 25 years although the documentary mentioned it briefly and glossed over that part, and he cried when he revissited the crash site, saying there was loss of life here, but then says all he saw was debris of a craft. Also according to the account of several in the military, a good handful of men vanished, never to be seen again. And, I mean, with everyone ridiculing the story at the time anyway, the money would be tempting. Fear is also a good tool, which is the method given in most late accounts. 

3. We are not talking about the legislative branch here. We are talking about the executive branch. And granted, the executive branch is very wasteful and has no business sense, but it's all in the name of an fast response up and down the chain of command, and backup plans and redundancies. How many service members have been stationed at commands who do nothing for years but are at a location doing drills just in case? So sometimes it's not a matter of efficiency, but efficacy, contingency, and redundancy. The United states executive is ***very*** effective. Chain of command is key to understanding this. Everyone is present exactly where they are supposed to be or they go to Leavenworth to live on a bread and water diet for a year. Everyone does what they are told. They are obsessive about protocol in communication and response times. Most drills are about communication. You are only as effective your weakest link. Anyone who has been in the military can attest to how frustrating it is when they get out and join the civilian sector. So many fumbles on the simplest of things. This is because while the civilian sector in total has a much higher level of education, and is much more efficient of necessity, the communication is not streamlined for speed, and especially not the execution. People argue. People sit on things. They can just randomly decide they aren't going to do something and their boss is the one who gets in trouble if their boss forces them. People are allowed to just not show up, so they won't be answering the phone that day. And I don't remember any answering machines. People quit. People leave their posts, etc. Remove these obstacles and it's completely different. So I could see how this common misconception about the military and the entire government being too incompetent for shuch a coverup could arise among civilians.

5. As well, if you ask people who are in intel, they will tell you that there are many well kept secrets.

6. There's not much that requires covering up. By the very nature of the subject, the story sounds bizarre. As current events show, eyewitness testimoney counts for nothing even from military personel and high ranking officials with a proveable right to know. Mainly it's only the physical evidence that is of concern. Not even photos and videos count. And who would trust a youtube video? Some of them ***could*** be real, right? 

7. People like Richard Doty say exactly how they carried out the more nefarious forms of counter intel. He is a perfect example of how the goverment DID attempt do cover SOMETHING up. Why not just tell the guy "Hey, this is top secret technology, for national security reasons we can't have you poking around?" And if I were in charge of a recovery team, the gas masks would be alien masks. How could you take an image of craft and beings seriously, if there were alien gas masks involved, even if it were 4k? 

8. If you have ever tracked the mainstream news media on a subject you are an expert in or on a subject that you really like to stay up to date on, or if have been in the military or government, you will know just how slowly news spreads. Even in 2023. They pretend like something happened yesterday when it was last month or even last year. Counter intel has ample time to track local news media and squelch something. AI is a perfect example. It took 5 months for the news media to take it seriously at all. So in that example, if intel shut down OpenAI at any point in that time period and confiscated the technology, no one would believe that the technolgy existed.

9. Most people don't realize how many military bases there are worldwide, not to mention CIA personel. The intel community has much more ground coverage than one might think. And there really only need to be a few agents within a few hours of most international airports. In most stories they take days to arrive anyway. 

10. And really there are no men in black. Supressing information is a pretty standard counter intel procedure. Men in polos for recon, men in suits for intimidation. Black is just pretty common for the CIA.
