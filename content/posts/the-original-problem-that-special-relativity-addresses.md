Key to having a good general context for the theory of special relativity and how and where it applies is to understand a simple point of departure that Einstein was taking in developing the theory.

Contrary to what most people seem to think, special relativity is ***not*** the insight that all motion is relative to the motion of some other object. That idea had long been accepted as universal and was first proposed by Galileo in the early 17th centry. 

A good example of galilean relativity is where if you play catch in a train moving at a constant velocity, it will be exactly as if you were playing catch on the ground. 

In fact, no one in some 300 years could find even one instance where motion was ***not*** relative. And indeed it'll break your brain trying to imagine such a thing. 

So, for instance, it was already well established that if someone throws a ball at you at say 10mph, and you are running 2mph towards it, the ball will appear to be moving toward you at 12mph. It's impossible to imagine this being otherwise.

And conversely if a quarter back is running backward at 3mph, and he throws the ball at 30mph, the effective ground speed of the ball is 27mph.

But Maxwell's equations for electromagetism, and various experiments like the Michelson-Morley experiment, which showed there is no medium such as aether in which light travels and no 'drift' implied that this might not be true for light.

So Einstein opens his book on the the theory of special relativity first illustrating galilean relativity and then supposing that this were ***not*** true for light.

What if regardless, of how fast an observer is moving toward or away from a light source, the same speed is measured?

So for instance, suppose that the observer were going half the speed of light toward the light source. Common sense would say that the speed at wich the observer and light are closing in on each other should be 1 1/2 times the speed of light. What if however, it turned out to be the speed of light?

Lets say that two observers were going toward the light source. One at half the speed of light, the other at say a quarter the speed of light. Common sense would then say that surely the first observer would measure the light coming at him at 1 1/4 the speed of light and the other at 1 1/2 the speed of light. What if they both measured the light coming at them at exactly the same speed?

How could this possibly be the case? But just supposing?

It sounds ridiculous, but all of Einsteins theories pivoted on this, and while it has been hard to directly prove in experiment, the thoery of special reliativity pivots on this point and many of its even ***more*** absurd implications ***have*** been confirmed in experiment.

So while the statement that the speed of light ,'c', is constant is normally taken for granted as a statement of fact as mundane as the boiling point of water, in reality it is quite a conundrum. 

But after accepting the true sense in which he meant this, it is fairly straight forward to understand his other thought experiments regarding special relativity and get a good intuitive grasp of the kinds of things the theory implies and why.
