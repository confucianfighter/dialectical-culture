I really like Elon Musk but...

If I were an aerospace company in possession of an aircraft of unkown origin with technology I wanted an exclusive shot at reverse engineering, the last person I would tell on the entire planet is a billionaire genious maverick who specializes in...AEROSPACE ENGINEERING!

If I were the CIA and wished to keep a technology under wraps because I was afraid another country might figure it out before the United States and use it against us, I would hire counter-intel to make sure no one in SpaceX learns anything of it. SpaceX would be such a huge potential for a leak, Elon Musk is a high profile person. Do you know who the name of the CEO of Northrop Grumman or any other AEROSPACE company? How about the name of the director of NASA? If it were up to me to guard the secret, Elon musk would live in a partially fictional world of my own making. 

I mean, he is already talking about working with China on AI development. Which I don't think is a horrible idea, because we need to know what they are up to. But he may or may not be aligned with the interests of the United States as far as DOD and Intel is concerned.

Just saying.

And he says that he would know because space is his thing, he puts rockets in space, satellites in space, is working on a mission to the moon, a mission to mars.

Even so, is he saying that he has a better view of the skies and space than:

1. The combined visual scope of all military and civilian pilots
2. The combined radar surveilance of the entire US Navy Fleet
3. The entire surveilance apparatus of the united states intel community.
4. The combined field of view of every person in the world.
5. The mind bogglingingly expansive space surveillance capabilities of the United States space force?

So since his lidar and radar that are designed mainly to direct rockets and satellites to very specific points in space and to avoid obstacles haven't capture evidence of extraterrestrial life, we should take his word for it and stop looking despite the testimonty of dozens of highly credible witnesses? 

He also argues that they surely would have said hello by now.

Why? What is the logic behind this? They are in danger as soon as they appear. One could argue that each government is obligated to try their hardest to be the first to capture them to get ahead on research and development in order to protect their citizens just in case the intruders are hostile, or in case another country gets ahold of the technology. 

They would be far more advanced than us but I'm sure they would still have vulnerabilities. We are far superior to chimpanzees, but they can still very easily kill us. The only difference with us is that we don't have any wild animals with long range capabilities. But I mean, you can be killed by a team of bees.

It's likely, instead, that until we are on an equal footing at least in our fundamental understanding of physics, it's not a good idea to interact with us for a plethora of reasons, but mainly for the reason above that we could and should be a danger to them in order to obtain their technology, and likely it would create a war. A metaphorical Black Thursday at best buy amongst countries.

So they observer. Intellignece mainly observes.

As Elon Musk himself argues when speaking on AI Alignment, the safest drive of a superintellignece is curiosity. And one of the points he makes is that curiosity requires observation, and so observation requires non-interference. So to my point superintelligences might only interact by observing eachother. Maybe it's just their mode to observe and be as invisible as possible.
