There is a version of Christianity that is truly free and it is an influence we may put at work within ourslelves.

Evangelical Christianity might at first appear to be that version. But it has a cost and that cost is to assert that which is not certain or likely at all.

The only virtue in Evanglical Chrsitianity seems to be to hold to the specific believe that Jesus died for us and rose from the dead. No one is worthy, so Jesus has lowered the bar so that you need only believe. If you won't even do that, though, you are an ingrate. 

Specific irrational beliefs are the key organizing element of maniuplation in a cult.

Basically, if it is a credible belief then you wouldn't need to isolate into a flock to protect said beleifs.

People also find it helpful to throw money at something to get themselves to believe it more. And this is all very convenient.

This seems to be diametrically opposed to the main idea behind the things that Jesus is recorded as having said. And if he really thought we should hold to irrational beliefs, this is likely a sign he wasn't God. A good person would never promote such a manipulative narrative, so why would a good God?

Instead, there was indeed good news about Jesus, and that news was that Jesus was not special. What he had was as free and abundant as dirt. It is the gateway to the higher power via love. It requires self work, but the work itself is the thing being offered. It is therefore free. It is perfectly rational and does not require one to comprimise who one truly is or what one truly thinks.
