I watched [this news update](https://youtu.be/QRDuj6aa_jQ) on breaking points.

Which referenced [this article](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-rounds-introduce-new-legislation-to-declassify-government-records-related-to-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-and-ufos_modeled-after-jfk-assassination-records-collection-act--as-an-amendment-to-ndaa) on none other than [democrats.senate.gov](democrats.senate.gov), the official website of the ***Democrats***.

Which stated that:
> Washington, D.C. – Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) are leading an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act which would mandate government records related to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) carry the presumption of disclosure. The Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) Disclosure Act of 20is modeled on the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 and will create a UAP Records Collection.

And proceeded to summarize the amendment and included a [full pdf](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/uap_amendment.pdf) of the proposal.

I knew that this was a bipartisan issue, but was still surprised.

And I had seen bits and pieces of the proposal but what is most surprising to me is the level of confidence and how 'matter of fact' things are stated in the full text. 

Especially I hadn't realized how they were defining their terms, until Sagaar pointed it out:

> Unidentified Anamolous Phenomena
(A) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘‘unidentified
anomalous phenomena’’ means any object operating or judged capable of operating in outerspace, the atmosphere, ocean surfaces, or undersea lacking prosaic attribution due to performance characteristics and properties not previously known to be achievable based upon commonly accepted physical principles. Unidentified
anomalous phenomena are differentiated from
both attributed and temporarily non-attributed
objects by one or more of the following
 observables:
 (i) Instantaneous acceleration absent
 apparent inertia.
 (ii) Hypersonic velocity absent a thermal signature and sonic shockwave.
 (iii) Transmedium (such as space-to ground and air-to-undersea) travel.
 (iv) Positive lift contrary to known
 aerodynamic principles.
 (v) Multispectral signature control.
 (vi) Physical or invasive biological effects to close observers and the environment.

> NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
The term ‘‘non-human intelligence’’ means any sentient intelligent non-human lifeform regardless of nature or ultimate origin that may be presumed responsible for unidentified anomalous phenomena or of which the Federal Government has become aware.

> PROSAIC ATTRIBUTION
The term ‘‘prosaic attribution’’ means having a human either foreign or domestic) origin and operating according to current, proven, and generally understood scientific and engineering principles and established laws-of nature and not attributable to non-human intelligence.

> CONTROLLED DISCLOSURE CAMPAIGN
The term ‘‘Controlled Disclosure Campaign
Plan’’ means the Controlled Disclosure Campaign
Plan required by section ll09(c)(3).(2) 

> CLOSE OBSERVER.—The term ‘‘close observer’’ means anyone who has come into close proximity to unidentified anomalous phenomena or nonhuman intelligence
Just that changes the way I would interpret the things I had read.

And the final definition is of particular interest:

> UNIDENTIFIED ANOMALOUS PHENOMENA RECORD.—The term ‘‘unidentified anomalous phenomena record’’ means a record that is related to
unidentified anomalous phenomena, technologies of
unknown origin, or non-human intelligence (and all
equivalent subjects by any other name with the specific and sole exclusion of temporarily non-attributed
objects) that was created or made available for use
by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of—

> (A) the Executive Office of the President;

> (B) the Department of Defense and its
progenitors, the Department of War and the
Department of the Navy;

> (C) the Department of the Army;

> (D) the Department of the Navy;

> (E) the Department of the Air Force, spe7 cifically the Air Force Office of Special Inves8 tigations;

> (F) the Department of Energy and its progenitors, the Manhattan Project, the Atomic
Energy Commission, and the Energy Research
and Development Administration;

> (G) the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence;

> (H) the Central Intelligence Agency and
its progenitor, the Office of Strategic Services;

> (I) the National Reconnaissance Office;

> (J) the Defense Intelligence Agency;

> (K) the National Security Agency;

> (L) the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency;

> (M) the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration:

> (N) the Federal Bureau of Investigation;

> (O) the Federal Aviation Administration;

> (P) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration;

> (Q) the Library of Congress;

> (R) the National Archives and Records Ad5 ministration;

> (S) any Presidential library;

> (T) any Executive agency;

> (U) any independent office or agency;

> (V) any other department, office, agency,
committee, or commission of the Federal Government;

> (W) any State or local government department, office, agency, committee, or commission
that provided support or assistance or performed work, in connection with a Federal inquiry into unidentified anomalous phenomena,
technologies of unknown origin, or non-human
intelligence; and

> (X) any private sector person or entity formerly or currently under contract or some other
agreement with the Federal Government.

It all reads much differently to me, with the terms defined in such an unequivocal way.
