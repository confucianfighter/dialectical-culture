12 step programs typically require participants to have an addiction.

I don't think this is consistent with the main thrust of the 12 step concept.

I think the main idea is to see how absolutely finite we are and embrace it.

For instance, if I feel entitled to my next breath of air, the 12 steps are for me.

I don't know everything about 12 step programs, but my one y
ear participation in AA changed my life.

Basically in a 12 step program, the participant first admits to having no ultimate control (I'm Daylan, I'm an air-o-holic).

Sees that the illusion of control and feeling of entitlement is at the root of his/her misery.

Participates in a faith agnostic liturgy that upholds the higher power of one's own conception. It's absolutely vital that this be that thing the participant him/herself comes up with as something worthy to be callled a higher power. 

From this stance openly observes and confesses those areas where there is this false perception of power.

Focusses little by little on the self work that removes the inner obstacles to love, forgiveness, and willingness.

Comes to see the group as a part of a higher calling to maintaining and promoting this inner work.

What's cool about these kinds of programs is that there is barely any management. There is like a 3 page liturgy which a random participant gets assigned to lead the group with. Follow the liturgy and its like magic. And indeed because of this one can really get the sense of the thing is being run by the ideals themselves, or some higher order. 

I'm brainstorming, but this is kind of what I remember of the spirit of AA.
