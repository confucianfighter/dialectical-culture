### Definition of time:
That space in which trajectories are defined

### Measure of time:
The number of times a predictable recurring thing happens during the trajectory 
of another thing.

### Can space be defined in terms of time?
That space in which trajectories may converge or divirge.

### Step by step.

I have one point, in space. I am nowhere and everywhere I am past and future.

I have two points in space. I see only an interval of an undefined length of an undefined direction. 

Moving one of those points changes nothing.

I have 3 points in space. I can see ratios but have no measure of the distances between them.

If I move one point, that ratio changes. 

If I move two points at the same time, I cannot know for certain if two points moved or one point  moved.

I therefore have only one inertial frame of reference.

If I add one more point I can see one moving in relation to the other three. Can I measure anything?
