Is there some some song about a boy.
Born almost dying from cows milk.
Who barely overcame,
Who drowned,
who was saved by his older sister,
who was told to be scared of ***everything***,
who was scolded severly for being scared of ***anything***,
who they continued to poison with cows milk,
who they said was slow, who they said was weak,
who persevered,
who overcame,
who overachieved and excelled both physically and mentally,
who was full of honor and passion,
who loved his dad very much
whom his mom tricked into hating his dad.
Who poisoned himself once more,
Who broke his fathers heart by rejecting him in the worse way every day for years,
who watched his father go from everyone's hero, to bed ridden, because of this,
Who dropped out of the seventh grade and struggled many years without reword,
Who suffered humilation from all his peers who used to look up to him,
Who literally thought his destination was hell, that he was worse than a serial killer or child molester,
whose only friend was his step dad who taught him to surf
Who dissociated, learned some cognitive thereapy and joined the navy, 
who disowned his stepdad who then died of an overdose.
Who learned many things and saw the world
who accomplished very little
who understood everyone
whom no one understood
Who began to bloom late
who became opposite of everything he believed in,
who did things all over town he would later be shunned for,
and died again
who came to an understanding of everything
and bloomed only to die again
who hopes now, still a child, still at the beginning of his life.
